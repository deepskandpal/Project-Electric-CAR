# Abstract
With the rising problem of global pollution and the decrease in world oil re- sources electric vehicles are becoming a necessity. This project focuses on designing an Ancillary system for a proposed electric vehicle (eV) which will be used for sys- tem diagnostics of every subsystems involved along with smart Regenerative Braking System technology And check the feasibility of the system with a real world appli- cation.The main components of the project are Battery Management System which aims to make efficient use of batteries by preventing it from overcharging and dis- charging,Regenerative Braking System, a method of braking of an electric vehicle which helps in efficient utilization of the battery power to increase the range of the vehicle and CAN protocol which is a serial bus communications protocol minimizing the wiring complexities.
